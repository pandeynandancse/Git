git status                     -->            inspects the contents of working directory and staging area
git add file_name              -->            adds the 'file_name' from working directory to staging area
git add file_name1 file_name2  -->            adds the multiple file from working directory to staging area
git commit                     -->            permanently stores changes from staging area to repository
git diff                       -->            shows the file difference between working directory and staging area

Definition of 'head commit'                        -->    'In many cases, the most recently made commit is head commit.'

git reset HEAD a.txt           -->            Unstages file changes from the staging area of file name 'a.txt' to working directory

git reset commit_SHA           -->            Resets to a previous commit in your commit history. commit_SHA contains first 6 chars of commit id.

                                                 Branching in Git
              
              
                                        
git branch                     -->             Lists all a Git repository's branches.
git branch branch_name         -->             Creates a new branch.
git checkout branch_name       -->             Used to switch from one branch to another.
git merge branch_name          -->             Used to join file changes from one branch to another.
git branch -d branch_name      -->             Deletes the branch specified.




                                            
                                                Cloning from Github
                                                
                                                
git clone                       -->             Creates a local copy of a remote.
git remote -v                   -->             Lists a Git project's remotes or to check what is project's origin.
                                                we can see that it gives you the origin name from where you have cloned the  corresponding project.


git fetch                       -->             Fetches work from the remote into the local copy.
git merge origin/master         -->             Merges origin/master into your local branch.
git push origin <branch_name>   -->             Pushes a local branch to the origin remote.
                                                
git pull origin master          -->             If there is any change in remote copy then you have to update it with your local copy
                                                so do this as 'fetch and merge takes two steps .It does the same work  in one step.
